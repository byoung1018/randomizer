# randomizer

This is an iOS app that allows you to put in options and have the app choose one of them at random.  It's a bare bones version right now because I made it for all my indecisive friends (I guess I can take out indecisive and it will be the same group...) that have iPhones.  It's basically an excuse to play around with Swift, Xcode and iOS apps a little - I have a droid.  

Right now the keyboard (when typing in an option) needs a button to hide the keyboard.  If I decide to spend more time on this I'm going to add savable presets and make the thing look puuurty (a little color never hurt).
